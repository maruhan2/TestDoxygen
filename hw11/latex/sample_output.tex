This is a sample run of a correctly working myspell program. Note that this example does not cover all edge cases, but is instead meant to demonstrate formatting. Please ask the graders for more direction if the formatting is unclear for any situtation not shown here.

None of the following lines contain a space before the newline (including the blank line). The output was terminated using Ctrl-\/\-D, so one blank line is left after the \char`\"{}yay\-: bay\char`\"{} line.

The debugging line (15 expansions...) is sent to cerr. The other lines go to cout.
